 ## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
 There are no necessary libraries to be added aside from the Anaconda distribution for Python. Code is written and should be used in Python3
 
 ## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
 
Part of technical challenge for Head Credit/Data , example of Credit EDA and Scorecard modelling, time spent on building 4h. From these notebooks you'll understand
 
1. How do I group features under a credit rubric?
2. What is the most important variable at classifiying between a good or bad creditor?
3. How can I improve my credit score under this model?

The full set of files related to this repo are public and free of use. 

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
There are 2 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions, the first notebook is an EDA of the dataset, we seek to understand the dataset and to plot our insights. After that the Second notebook aims at answering the main question, what makes a borrower good or bad, and how can someone under this model improve their standing.

## Results<a name="results"></a>
We've found a good configuration using Logistic Regression that allows us to have an AUC of 65% in test with enough support for stable features. We've also computed an example of how a scorecard methodology could help in understanding the impacts of each feature into the model.
